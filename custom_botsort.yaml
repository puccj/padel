# BoT-SORT tracker optimized for Padel Tennis
# Static camera, ball tracking challenges, player interactions

tracker_type: botsort # (str) Tracker backend: botsort|bytetrack; choose botsort to enable BoT-SORT features

# Detection thresholds - optimized for padel
track_high_thresh: 0.3 # (float) Raised from 0.25 - cleaner tracks for players, reduces false ball detections
track_low_thresh: 0.15 # (float) Raised from 0.1 - better balance for ball recovery vs noise
new_track_thresh: 0.3 # (float) Raised from 0.25 - reduces false tracks, especially for ball

# Tracking persistence - crucial for ball tracking
track_buffer: 200 # (int) Increased from 100 - keeps ball tracks alive longer during occlusions
match_thresh: 0.6 # (float) Lowered from 0.8 - more lenient matching for ball recovery
fuse_score: True # (bool) Keep enabled - helps with weak ball detections

# BoT-SORT specifics - optimized for static camera
gmc_method: none # (str) Disabled since camera is static - saves computation and avoids drift

# ReID model - optimized for player interactions
proximity_thresh: 0.3 # (float) Raised from 0.2 - stricter for player proximity, reduces ID swaps
appearance_thresh: 0.75 # (float) Lowered from 0.8 - more lenient for player appearance changes
with_reid: True # (bool) Keep enabled - essential for player re-identification after hugs/crosses
model: auto # (str) ReID model name/path; "auto" uses detector features if available
